The `MultiLineCsvParser` is copyright footloosejava (https://github.com/footloosejava) (real name unknown).


Many of the other classes were copied directly from the OpenCSV svn, taking the unpublished (to maven central) OpenCSV-2.4 version.  Most of those classes retain their original copyright notices from the OpenCSV authors and contributors.

I've kept the same license as OpenCSV, so simplcsv is released under the Apache 2.0 license, reproduced here:
